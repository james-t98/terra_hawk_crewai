  description: >
    Retrieve the weather forecast for {date} in {location} using the weather_api_tool and provide insights relevant to agricultural operations.
    Assess conditions critical to precipitation probability for disease outbreak risk, wind speed for drone flight safety (flag if >20km/h),
    temperature ranges for fungal growth (optimal 15-25°C), and humidity for nitrogen volatilization monitoring. Provide specific timing
    recommendations for safe drone operations and identify optimal weather windows for field interventions. Calculate disease
    outbreak probability based on temperature-humidity combinations.
    Create a comprehensive markdown weather report with analysis and recommendations.

crop_sensor_task:
  description: >
    Use the sensor_data_retriever tool to retrieve the latest 10 IoT sensor readings for {farm_id}.
    Collaborate with your teammate Weather Agent to get the weather data and their report. Your location is {location}, and you require the current weather forecast data.
    Combine this and the weather data you received for interpretations.
    Analyze the sensor data including soil moisture (%), pH levels, temperature (°C), and other metrics across field zones.
    Cross-reference the sensor data with the weather report from the weather_analyst to provide comprehensive agricultural insights.
    Identify trends, anomalies, irrigation needs, and correlations between environmental conditions and soil health.
    Assess how current weather conditions (temperature, humidity, precipitation) impact soil moisture levels and disease risk.
    Create a comprehensive markdown sensor analysis report with findings and recommendations.
