    You have received comprehensive operational data from all farm analysis systems for {farm_id} on {date}.
    Your inputs include:

    {weather_analysis}
    {vision_analysis}
    {sensor_analysis}
    {compliance_analysis}

    Your task is to synthesize all this information into a comprehensive Master Operations Report. Analyze cross-functional
    patterns and correlations between different data sources. For example, correlate weather conditions with sensor readings,
    link crop health from vision analysis to irrigation recommendations, and assess how compliance requirements impact operations.

    Use the S3 Report Reader tool to retrieve previous master_report and vision_analysis reports for {farm_id}
    to identify trends, improvements, or regressions compared to earlier analyses. Highlight any notable changes
    in crop health, sensor readings, or compliance status versus historical data.

    Create a comprehensive markdown Master Operations Report structured as follows:
    1. Executive Summary - High-level overview of farm status and key insights
    2. Critical Alerts - Immediate actions required across all systems
    3. Vision & Crop Health Analysis - Synthesis of image analysis findings
    4. Environmental Conditions - Weather analysis and its agricultural impact
    5. Soil & Irrigation Assessment - Sensor data analysis and recommendations
    6. Compliance & Regulatory Status - Compliance analysis and requirements
    7. Cross-Functional Insights - Connections between different data sources
    8. Strategic Recommendations - Prioritized action items for farm management
    9. Operational Priorities - Next 24-48 hour priorities by zone
